Hi! 

I'd just like to thank the Specno team for the challenge, I really enjoyed the task.

Prior to this assessment, I had no experience with building APIs and this task prompted me to learn quite a bit - including how to use Node.js and MongoDB.

I thoroughly enjoyed this and regardless of the outcome, thank you for the opportunity.
